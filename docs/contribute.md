# Contributing to Phabalicious

If you get stuck at any point you can create a [ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/factorial-io/phabalicious/issues).

## Contributing to development

It's the usual, fork the repository, create a feature-branch, do your changes and submit a pull-request via Github. If your new feature has test-coverage the better.

We are happy for every contribution.

## Improving documenation

The procedure is the same as with contributing code.

The documentation is build via vue-press, to run it locally, do

```
yarn install
yarn docs:dev
```
